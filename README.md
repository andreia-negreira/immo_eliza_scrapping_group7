# Project Immo Eliza

## Description

This project aims to create an AI model that can estimate the value of a property based on the provided information. The AI receives data about properties and provides an estimated worth. The project is divided into four parts, with each part focusing on a specific aspect of the development process.

### Part 1: Data Acquisition

The first part of the project involves acquiring a dataset of houses and apartments for sale in Belgium. The dataset comprises information from approximately 10,000 properties. The dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the AI model.

#### Part 1: Installation and Usage

1. Create an environment in order to install all the required modules;
2. With an activated environment, run this command in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt;
3. Run the main.py in a Python environment;
4. The information will start to be retrieved;
5. Check the dataset in the new document dataset-immo.csv.

#### Aclnowldgments
